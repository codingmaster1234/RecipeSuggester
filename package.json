  "description": "Recipe Finder is a project that demonstrates the utilization of API queries with data visualization. In this case the API requests information from the developer Edamam.com endpoint, selected by a user generated search, diet preference, and health preference. The request returns a data object, which is then parsed and displayed in a table for the user to view with links to each recipe. You can try the demo [here](https://navkelley.github.io/recipeFinder/).",
